# ExaMPM Kokkos CUDA with Pybind11

This project explores using ExaMPM, an advanced Material Point Method (MPM) implementation optimized 
with Kokkos for GPU acceleration via CUDA. The goal is to interface ExaMPM with Python using **pybind11** 
and test it across a range of simple and complex simulation problems.

# Project Goals

- **Explore ExaMPM**: Experiment with ExaMPM's capabilities and performance on GPU.
- **Pybind11 Interface**: Build a Python interface for ease of experimentation.
- **Problem Testing**: Test and benchmark with various simulation scenarios.
